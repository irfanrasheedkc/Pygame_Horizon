# Horizon
Our project is a Ping Pong game created using the Python programming language and two popular libraries, namely Pygame and Tkinter. The objective of the game is to hit the ball back and forth across the table using a paddle, with the aim of making your opponent miss and score points. The game can be played in single-player mode against the computer, or in two-player mode with a friend.

The game features a user-friendly interface with simple graphics and sound effects that add to the overall gaming experience. The game also includes a scoreboard that keeps track of the score and displays the winner at the end of each round.

Overall, this Ping Pong game is an exciting and engaging project that showcases the use of two popular libraries, Tkinter and Pygame, to create a fun and interactive gaming experience. Whether you're a seasoned player or a beginner, this game will provide you with hours of entertainment and enjoyment.

## How it Works ?
1. The game starts with a welcome screen that prompts the user to choose the Game mode(vs CPU or vs player).

2. Once the user has selected the Game mode, the game screen appears. The game screen consists of a rectangular play area with two paddles, one for each player, and a ball in the center.

3. The players use the arrow keys on their keyboard to move their paddles up and down, trying to hit the ball back and forth between them.

4. When the ball collides with one of the paddles, it changes direction and bounces back into the play area.

5. If the ball goes past one of the paddles, the player whose paddle it went past loses a point.

6. The game continues until one of the players reaches a predetermined score.

7. At the end of the game, the winner is announced, and the players can choose to play again or exit the game.
